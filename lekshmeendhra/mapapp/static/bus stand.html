        <h1>BUS STAND</h1>
        <li>The Villupuram Bus Stand, located in Tamil Nadu, is one of the largest bus terminals in the state and serves as a major hub for transportation. 
            The town has two main bus stations: the New Bus Stand and the Old Bus Stand. 
            The New Bus Stand, situated about 2 kilometers from the Viluppuram Junction railway station in Pappankulam near Mariyamman Kovil, is mainly used for long-distance and intercity (mofussil) bus services.
            It is well-structured with three platforms, 67 bays, parking, bicycle facilities, and accessibility features for passengers. 
            The Old Bus Stand, located in K K Nagar, mostly handles town buses and local routes within the district. 
            Together, these bus stands connect Viluppuram with Chennai, Puducherry, Trichy, and several towns across Tamil Nadu, making it an important transit point for both daily commuters and long-distance travelers.
